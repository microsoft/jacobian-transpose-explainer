# Jacobian transpose explainer

Jacobian transpose explainer is an interactive visualisation to help
you understand multiplication by the Jacobian transpose.  This is
sometimes called "vector-Jacobian product" (vjp) as opposed to
"Jacobian-vector product" (jvp).  Reverse mode automatic
differentiation performs multiplication by the Jacobian transpose.
